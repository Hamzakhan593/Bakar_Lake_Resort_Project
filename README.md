# Bakar Lake Resort – Web Application

## Overview

**Bakar Lake Resort Web Application** is a real-world inspired project built using **ASP.NET Core MVC**. The idea came from a personal visit to **Bakar Lake Resort, Sanghar**, which is managed by the **Sindh Tourism Department**. Despite being a beautiful tourist spot with a dam, boating, and natural scenery, the resort did not have any online booking system or official website.

This gap motivated me to design and develop a complete resort booking web application where users can explore the resort and make reservations online.

## Motivation & Story Behind the Project

I started this project during my **4th semester** while learning web development concepts at university. Instead of building a generic academic project, I wanted to solve a **real problem**.

After visiting Bakar Lake Resort and noticing the absence of a booking website, I decided to:

* Learn **.NET / ASP.NET Core** from scratch
* Apply a **learning-by-doing approach**
* Build a practical system that reflects real-world requirements

This project represents my transition from learning theory to applying backend development concepts in a real scenario.


## Key Features

* User authentication and authorization using **ASP.NET Identity**
* Admin role management
* Resort room and package management
* Booking system with price calculation
* SQL Server database integration using **Entity Framework Core**
* Clean MVC architecture
* Secure login system


## Technologies Used

* **ASP.NET Core MVC**
* **C#**
* **Entity Framework Core**
* **SQL Server**
* **ASP.NET Identity**

## Project Structure

* **Models** – Business entities (Booking, Package, Room, Customer, etc.)
* **Controllers** – Application logic and request handling
